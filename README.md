# Rozells_and_Gavornik

This repository contains the code used in Rozells and Gavornik 2023. 
The code is a modified version of that used by Cone and Shouval in their 
2021 eLife paper "Learning precise spatiotemporal sequences via 
biophysically realistic learning rules in a modular, spiking network", 
https://elifesciences.org/articles/63751. 

Training_with_optogenetics.m - Create and train a network with user defined 
optogenetic modulation
Testing_with_optogenetics.m - Run the trained network with optogenetic 
manipulation 

HelperFunctions/ will be added to your path by Training_with_optogenerics
Figure Plotting Code/ contains code used to generate figures used in the 
paper

This code was run in MATLAB 2022a.
